        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Dot Diary collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Dot Diary
          website and app.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Controller</h2>
        <p>The controller for data processing under GDPR is the operator listed in the Impressum.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account information, including your email address.</li>
          <li>
            Diary data you create in the app, such as dot types, entries, note text, settings, and related metadata.
          </li>
          <li>Technical and usage data required to operate the service (for example auth/session and security logs).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Why We Collect Data and Legal Basis (Art. 6 GDPR)</h2>
        <p>We process data for the following purposes and legal bases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide app functionality (account access, sync, storage): Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract).</li>
          <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and keep systems stable: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests).</li>
          <li>Respond to support and legal/privacy requests: Art. 6(1)(c) and/or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Processors and Tools We Use</h2>
        <p>We use the following processors/subprocessors to run Dot Diary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supabase (authentication and cloud database).</li>
          <li>Vercel (hosting and delivery).</li>
          <li>Cloudflare (DNS and email routing/forwarding).</li>
          <li>Resend (transactional email delivery, when enabled).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We currently do not use Stripe, PostHog, or Google Analytics in the production app unless explicitly added in a
          future update to this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Where Data Is Stored and International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Data is stored and processed by our service providers in the regions they operate. Depending on provider
          infrastructure, data may be processed in the EU, the US, or other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers (for example, contractual transfer
          mechanisms provided by our vendors).
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Dot Diary uses essential storage/session technologies required to keep you signed in and operate core app
          functionality. We do not use non-essential advertising cookies in the current version of the app.
        </p>

        <h2>7. How Information Is Shared</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>With service providers that help operate Dot Diary (for example, infrastructure and auth providers).</li>
          <li>When required by law or legal process.</li>
          <li>To protect rights, safety, and security of users and the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain account and diary data while your account is active. If you request deletion, we delete or anonymize
          personal data unless we must keep specific records for legal obligations or security/fraud prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical logs are retained for a limited period based on operational necessity and provider defaults.
        </p>

        <h2>9. User Rights (GDPR and Similar Laws)</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, object, and data
          portability. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise rights, email
          <a href="mailto:hello@dot-diary.com">hello@dot-diary.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Encryption and Access to Diary Content</h2>
        <p>
          Data is transmitted over encrypted connections (TLS). Data stored by our providers may be encrypted at rest per
          provider standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dot Diary is not currently designed as end-to-end encrypted storage. That means authorized operators and service
          providers may be technically able to access stored content when necessary for support, security, legal
          compliance, or platform operations.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          You can request account and diary deletion by contacting
          <a href="mailto:hello@dot-diary.com">hello@dot-diary.com</a>. We process deletion requests within a reasonable
          timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)</h2>
        <p>Where legally required, we maintain Data Processing Agreements with relevant processors.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infrastructure/hosting providers (for example Vercel and Supabase).</li>
          <li>Email service providers used for transactional messages (for example Resend).</li>
          <li>Payment processors (for example Stripe), if and when payments are enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Dot Diary is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
          children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect personal information. No method of transmission or storage is
          completely secure.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective
          date above.
        </p>
